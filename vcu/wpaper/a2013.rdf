Title:  Taking, Giving, and Impure Altruism in Dictator Games
Abstract:  We show that, if giving is equivalent to not taking, impure altruism could account for List's(2007) finding that the payoff to recipients in a dictator game decreases when the dictator has theoption to take. We examine behavior in dictator games with different taking options butequivalent final payoff possibilities. We find that recipients tend to earn more as the amount thedictator must take to achieve a given final payoff increases, a result consistent with thehypothesis that the cold prickle of taking is stronger than the warm glow of giving. We concludethat not taking is not equivalent to giving and agree with List (2007) that the current socialpreference models fail to rationalize the observed data.
