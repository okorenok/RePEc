Title:  Banks and Output Fluctuations
Abstract:  This paper presents evidence that disturbances originating in the banking sector
can generate business cycles. The banking shocks are measured as innovations to the banking
sector√≠s conversion of deposits into loans: a measure of intermediation efficiency. Positive banking
efficiency shocks generate a significant positive impact on short-run output growth rates and a
negative impact on a version of the spread between short and long term interest rates. The
results are robust with respect to alternative calculations of the banking efficiency measure, to
identification using short versus long-run restrictions and to other reasonable variations in the
identification scheme.
