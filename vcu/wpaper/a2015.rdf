Title:  On Freezing Depositor Funds at Financially Distressed Banks: An 
Experimental Analysis
Abstract:  This paper reports an experiment conducted to evaluate the effects of alterations in the terms of repayments to depositors following a liquidity suspension as well as the effect of alterations in the publicity of information about withdrawal behavior on the fragility of distressed banks. Results indicate that a “tough” renegotiation stance, e.g. of protecting depositors who maintain their money in the bank,
can quite effectively promote stability. Information provided to 
depositors regarding past withdrawal behavior weakens the effectiveness of a tough 
renegotiation policy, but reduces fragility somewhat for a more lenient rescheduling 
condition.
