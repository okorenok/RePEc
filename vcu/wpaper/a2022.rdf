Title:  Is It Still an Econ Course? The Effect of a Standardized Personal Finance Test on the Learning of Economics.
Abstract:  We study the implications of mixing economics and personal finance standards
in a high school course. Using administrative, survey, and testing data on college
students, we find that learning personal finance can help the learning of economics
for some students and hurt it for others. We estimate that students who received more
instruction in economics score almost 5 percentage points higher on our economics
test. Furthermore, we estimate the effect of being assigned a certification test in per-
sonal finance as a part of this course. Taking the personal finance certification test
increases economics test scores by 2.5 percentage points for the average student, but
this effect is not uniform across students. The certification test significantly increases
the economics scores of students with low SAT scores, while decreasing the eco-
nomics scores of those with high SAT scores. Our results emphasize the potentially
idiosyncratic effects of mixing economics with personal finance.

Title:  Inflation and Attention Thresholds
Abstract:  One of the dangers of high inflation is that it can cause firms and households to pay close attention to it.
This internalization of inflation can lead to an accelerationist regime, making inflation harder to control. We empirically
assess the relationship between attention and the level of inflation for 37 countries. Our measures of attention are
constructed either from internet search behavior or the popularity of inflation mentions on Twitter. We find evidence
that attention thresholds do exist for the majority of countries in our sample. We also find interesting variability
across countries.

Title:  The Evolution of Labor Market Disparities between Hispanic and non-Hispanic Men: 1970-2019
Abstract:  We describe how ethnic disparities in the labor market between prime aged Hispanic
and non-Hispanic white men have evolved over the last 50 years. Using data from the
March CPS, the Census, and the ACS, we examine several employment and earning
outcomes. Hispanics have experienced sizable gains to employment: from a negative
2% prior to 1990 to a positive 4% after 2010 compared to non-Hispanics. In terms of
earnings, Hispanics face a substantial negative disparity between 20% and 30% with
some improvement after 2000. Most of the employment gain is driven by those with
less than a high school degree, while the earnings disparity increases with education.
Comparing Hispanic immigrants with natives reveals much of the employment and
earnings gains are attributable to Hispanic immigrants, particularly immigrants not
fluent in English.
