Title: Factors Affecting College Attainment and Student Ability in the U.S. since 1900
Abstract:  We develop a dynamic lifecycle model to study long-run changes in college com-
pletion and average ability of college students in cohorts born from 1900 to 1972.
The  model  is  disciplined  in  part  by  constructing  a  historical  time  series  on  real
college costs from printed government documents covering this time period.  The
model captures nearly all of the increase in attainment for 1900 to 1950 cohorts.
In  counterfactual  exercises  we  show  that  attainment  would  have  been  lower  by
almost half, on average, for 1925 to 1950 cohorts absent a large decrease in college
costs relative to income.  For post-1950 cohorts simultaneously rising college costs
and education premia act in opposite directions to result in low college enrollment
growth; however, endogenously declining average ability of college students lowers
overall completion rates in the model.  Furthermore, we find that economic factors
have little impact on average student ability; rather, the precision of signals about
true ability are the key driver of changes in average ability.  We utilize historical
data on the share of students who take SATs as a proxy for the increasing preci-
sion of ability signals, and show that this allows the model to match the aggregate
ability sorting patterns.

Title:  Taking Aversion
Abstract:  We determine whether the moral cost of taking exceeds the moral cost of not giving.  
We design and conduct an experiment to determine whether a dictator prefers a giving game 
over a taking game when the payoff possibilities are identical and to measure the strength 
of the preference. We find that aversion to taking is prevalent and strong.
Over 85% of the dictators in our experiment choose to play a giving game over a taking game when the 
payoff possibilities are identical and, on average, dictators 
are willing to sacrifice over 31% of their endowment to avoid taking.

Title:  Feelings of Ownership in Dictator Games
Abstract:  This paper determines if differences in feelings of ownership 
mediate the effect of changing who earns the endowment and the frame of actions 
on dictators’ generosity. We conduct an experiment with two treatments. 
The Dictator Earns-Give treatment is designed to induce strong 
feelings of ownership, while the Recipient Earns-Take treatment induces weak feelings of 
ownership. We measure feelings of ownership in the two treatments.
As expected, dictators report stronger feelings of ownership in the first treatment and 
these feelings mediate the dictator’s generosity. 
Moving from the Recipient Earns-Take treatment to the Dictator Earns-Give 
treatment indirectly reduces the payoff to the recipient by increasing the 
dictators’ feelings of ownership.
