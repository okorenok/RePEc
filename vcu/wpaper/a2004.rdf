Title:  Rebates, Matches, and Consumer Behavior
Abstract:  An experiment conducted to examine the effects of different discount formats on consumer purchases is reported. Participants made a series of purchase decisions for chocolate bars given (a) “rebates” from the listed price, (b) “matching” quantities of chocolates for each bar purchased, and (c) simple price reductions. Contrary to standard theoretical predictions, and consistent results in the context of charitable contributions by Eckel and Grossman (2003), we find that participants purchase significantly more chocolate bars under a “matching” sales format than under a comparable “rebate” format. Inattention to the net consequences of decisions, as well as some “rebate aversion”, explain the preference for matching discounts.

Title:  An Experimental Evaluation of the Serial Cost Sharing Rule
Abstract:  This paper proposes an experimental test of the strategic equilibrium
properties of the serial cost sharing rule originally proposed by
Shenker (1990) and then analyzed by Moulin and Shenker (1992). We
report measure of the performance and efficiency of the serial mechanism
by comparing the choices and payoffs attained by the subjects to
the expected first best allocations. Experimental evidence shows that,
while some learning is needed, the serial mechanism leads to almost
efficient allocations.
