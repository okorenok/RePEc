Title:  Hindsight, Foresight, and Insight: An Experimental Study of a Small-Market Investment
Game with Common and Private Values
Abstract:  We experimentally test an endogenous-timing investment model in which
subjects privately observe their cost of investing and a signal correlated with
the common investment return. Subjects overinvest, relative to Nash. We
separately consider whether subjects draw inferences, in hindsight, and use
foresight to delay profitable investment and learn from market activity. In
contrast to Nash, cursed equilibrium, and level-k predictions, behavior hardly
changes across our experimental treatments. Maximum likelihood estimates
are inconsistent with belief-based theories. We offer an explanation in terms
of boundedly rational rules of thumb, based on insights about the game, which
provides a better fit than QRE.

Title:  Can Relaxation of Beliefs Rationalize the Winner’s Curse?: An Experimental Study
Abstract:  We use a second-price common-value auction, the maximal game, to experimentally
study whether the Winner’s Curse (WC) can be explained by models
which retain best-response behavior but allow for inconsistent beliefs. In the
maximal game, the WC can be rationalized only by a belief that others use
weakly-dominated strategies. Yet, we find that the WC is widespread. In addition,
we create environments where, regardless of beliefs, there should be a
correction of the WC. We find little evidence of such a correction. Overall, our
study suggests that the WC, at least in initial periods of play in the laboratory,
represents a more fundamental departure from NE than a mere inconsistency
of beliefs.

Title:  Reported Progress under the Student Right-to-Know Act: How Reliable is It?
Abstract:  The Student Right-to-Know Act requires colleges to provide
institution-specific information on graduation rates for students initially
enrolling full-time in the fall term. Not all students enroll in that fashion,
especially at two-year institutions. We use data on degree-seeking students from
the 1996/2001 Beginning Post-Secondary Survey to identify students for whom
statistics are and are not reportable under the Act and to track their progress.
Results indicate the published progress rates are substantially higher than
the progress rates for the non-reportable populations, whether students
enter a two-year or a four-year institution. While progress rates for the two
samples are significantly correlated within four-year institutions, they are
not within two-year institutions. For those beginning at two-year institutions,
the progress rates reported under the Student Right-to-Know Act are indicative
of neither their absolute nor their relative (cross-institution) probability
of success. Policy makers and prospective students will not make efficient decisions
without better information.

Title:  Increasing Returns to Education and Progress towards a College Degree
Abstract:  Returns to college have increased, but graduation rates have changed
relatively little. Modifying a human capital model of college enrollment to
endogenize time-to-graduation, we predict that higher returns to education will
both speed graduation and increase enrollment. Some of those new entrants may,
however, take longer to graduate. Using the 1989 and 1995 Beginning Postsecondary
Studies, we employ a multinomial logit to model the association between individual
and family characteristics, and five-year college outcomes: graduation, continued
enrollment, and non-enrollment. Between cohort differences arise either because
the characteristics of those entering college are different or because the
relations between characteristics and outcomes have changed. We utilize a
Oaxaca-Blinder style decomposition to distinguish between these two
alternatives, attributing differences in characteristics to newly attracted
students and differences in the relations between characteristics and
outcomes to historically attracted students behaving differently.
It is changes in behavior that explain the increased progress we observe.

Title:  Institutions, Social Norms, and Bargaining Power: An Analysis of Individual Leisure Time in Couple Households
Abstract:  We exploit time use data from Denmark and the United States to examine the
impact institutions and social norms have on individuals' bargaining power within
a household, hypothesizing that the more generous social welfare system and more
egalitarian social norms in Denmark will mitigate the impact standard economic
power measures have upon couples' time use. Further we posit that leisure time will
be more sensitive to power considerations than housework time which may be more
influenced by preferences regarding household public goods, to gendered notions
of time use, and to censoring. Our results are generally supportive of these
hypotheses, with leisure time on non-work days in the US being particularly
responsive to economic power. In addition, we find some evidence that institutions
matter as women in the US who are more likely to receive welfare benefits enjoy more
leisure time than would be suggested by their economic power alone.

Title:  Experimental Evidence on Other-Regarding Preferences: Dictators Give to Help the Less Fortunate
Abstract:  In the typical dictator game, the majority of dictators choose to pass at least a portion
of their endowment to recipients who are given no endowment. We modify the dictator game by
giving the recipient an endowment. We then measure the impact of varying the recipient’s
endowment on the amount passed by the dictator. As the recipient’s endowment increases, the
majority of dictators decrease the amount passed and pass nothing when endowments are
equalized. We conclude that in the typical dictator game most dictators pass because they care
about the recipients who are given no endowments.

Title:  Behavioral Convergence Properties of Cournot and Bertrand Markets: An Experimental Analysis
Abstract:  This paper reports an experiment that examines the relative convergence
properties of differentiated-product Cournot and Bertrand oligopolies. Overall, Bertrand markets
tend to converge to Nash equilibrium predictions more quickly and more completely
than Cournot markets. Further, when products are close substitutes Bertrand markets
respond more quickly to an announced nominal shock. As products become weaker substitutes,
however, an increased tendency for tacit collusion degrades convergence in Bertrand markets.
This effect is particularly pronounced following a nominal shock. Our results suggest
that in an oligopoly context variations in decision error costs dominate a 'Strategic Substitutes Effect'
isolated in previous experimental research.
