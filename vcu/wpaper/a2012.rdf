Title:  Wage inequality, tasks and occupations
Abstract:  This paper assesses the relationship between occupation attributes andchanges in wage inequality finding partial support for the computerization hypothesis. 
While wages associated with non-routine cognitive tasks have risen;current versions of the hypothesis cannot explain the pattern of within 
occupation wage changes, the differential impact of various types of non-routinecognitive tasks and the declining return to tasks that complement machines.Despite significant employment shifts, occupational composition alone matterslittle for changes in wage inequality. Changes in wage dispersion within 
occupations are quantitatively just as important as wage changes between occupationsfor explaining wage inequality between 1980 and 2000.
