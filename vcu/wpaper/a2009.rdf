Title:  War Mobilization and the Great Compression
Abstract:  During the 1940s, the diversion of 55\% of the workforce to war-time production,
the induction of over 10 million young men into the armed forces and the entry of millions of
female, young and elderly workers into workplace subject the labor force to large shocks.
Also during the 1940s the wage distribution compressed sharply and the returns to education fell.
This paper uses between occupation wage changes to link war-time labor market shocks to the decline
in the return to education and to the decline in wage inequality. War-time production favoring
less-educated labor along with the occupation-biased nature of the draft combined
to compress both the lower and upper tails of the male wage distribution and the upper
portion of the female wage distribution.

Title:  Attitudes to Ambiguity in One-Shot Normal-Form Games: An Experimental Study
Abstract: Based on an experiment in the lab, we classify behavior in one-shot normal-form
games along three important dimensions. The first dimension, which is
of main interest, is about whether subjects are ambiguity-loving, ambiguity-neutral,
or ambiguity-averse. The second dimension is about whether subjects
are risk-loving, risk-neutral, or risk-averse. The third dimension is about
whether subjects are naive or strategic. Our main result is that, in our main
treatment, 32/46/22 percent of subjects are classified as ambiguity-loving/ambiguity-neutral/
ambiguity-averse.

Title:  Non-Price Determinants of Automotive Demand: Restyling Matters Most
Abstract:  This paper analyzes market share changes in automobile and light truck submarkets.
We find that new product, as measured by restyling, represents the most consistent, dominant
determinant of demand. On average a ten percent reduction in relative price would yield only
one-tenth the market share impact of a restyling. Alternatively, one would have to double one’s
relative advertising expenditures to match the impact of a restyling. Several demand
determinants not previously modeled, including rebranding and warranty curtailments, were
detrimental to domestic manufacturer market shares. Safety appliance adoptions and changes in
vehicle reliability had minimal impact on demand.

Title:  How do Adolescents Spell Time Use?
Abstract:  We investigate how household disadvantage affects the time use of 15-18 year-olds using 2003-
2006 data from the American Time Use Survey. Applying competing-risk hazard models, we
distinguish between the incidence and duration of activities and incorporate the daily time
constraint. We find that teens living in disadvantaged households spend less time in nonclassroom
schooling activities than other teens. Girls spend some of this time in work activities,
suggesting they are taking on adult roles. However we find more evidence of substitution into
unsupervised activities, suggesting that it may be less structured environments that reduce
educational investment.
