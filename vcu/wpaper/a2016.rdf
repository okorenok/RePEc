Title: Experimental Methods for the General Economist: Five lessons from the Lab
Abstract:  I review a series five primary results from experimental economics that impact on the economics profession as a whole. These results regard the relative (un)importance of subject sophistication in laboratory markets, the importance of gender on economic outcomes, the propensity for humans to behave in less than fully rational ways, the importance of trading institutions on economic performance and the behavioral relevance of economic theory.  In overview, I find that economics as a profession has benefited from the use of experimental methods by fostering a dialogue between theorists and empiricists, better informing policy and improving data collection techniques.

Title: The Changing Roles of Family Income and Academic Ability for US College Attendance
Abstract:  We harmonize the results of a number of historical studies to document changes
in the patterns of who attends college over the course of the 20th century. We find
that family income or socioeconomic status were more important predictors of who
attended college before World War II, whereas academic ability was afterward. We 
construct a model that explains this change through a decline in search costs, 
motivated by the movement to standardize college admissions and disseminate college
information in the 1950s. Our model generates the reversal in sorting seen in the
data as well as several other patterns documented in the literature using primarily
this single driving force.

Title: Reforming the Social Security Earnings Cap: The Role of Endogenous Human Capital
Abstract:  Old age Social Security benefits in the US are funded by a 10.6% payroll tax up
to a cap, currently set at $118,500. Despite calls from policy circles to eliminate the
cap on taxable earnings, there has been little work examining the likely outcomes
of such a policy change. I use a life-cycle human capital model with heterogeneous
individuals to investigate the aggregate and distributional steady state impacts of
several policy changes to the earnings cap. I find: (1) Eliminating the earnings
cap generates large reductions in aggregate output and consumption, between 2.1-
3.1%. (2) The role of endogenous human capital is first order: when I do not allow
the life-cycle human capital profiles of workers to adjust across policy regimes, the
change in economic aggregates is roughly cut in half. (3) While eliminating the
earnings cap increases revenues from the payroll tax by 12%, the decline in output
lowers tax revenues from other sources, so that total federal tax revenues never
increase by more than 1.2%. (4) Eliminating the earnings cap produces modest
welfare gains for about 2/3 of workers, while about 1/3 of workers experience
welfare losses, which are typically large. (5) Lowering the earnings cap to a level
near the mean of earnings increases aggregate output by 1.3%, and also increases
welfare for the vast majority of workers.

Title: Learning by Doing and Ben-Porath: Life-cycle Predictions and Policy Implications
Abstract:  Many government policies affect incentives to acquire human cap-
ital. Two workhorse models dominate the literature analyzing these policies: 
Learning by Doing (LBD) and Ben-Porath (BP). This pa-
per makes two novel findings related to these models. First, LBD 
and BP generate different life-cycle predictions. Second, the model
features that generate different life-cycle predictions between mod-
els also generate different policy implications. Specifically, increasing
marginal labor tax rates for top earners depresses human capital 
accumulation more under BP. As a result, the Laffer curve for top
marginal income tax rates is flatter, and peaks 10 percentage points
lower, with BP versus LBD.
