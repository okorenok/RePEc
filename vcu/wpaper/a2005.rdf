Title:  Empirical Comparison of Sticky Price and Sticky Information Models
Abstract:  Mankiw and Reis (2002) have revived imperfect information explanations for
the short run real effects of monetary policy. This paper contrasts their sticky
information model with the standard sticky price model. First, I utilize a theoretical
relation between aggregate prices and unit labor cost that allows
me to leave unspecified household preferences, wage setting and money demand.
Second, I introduce a modeling approach that allows me to nest the sticky price
and the sticky information models within a single
empirical framework. Third, I propose a single-step estimation method that provides
consistent estimates of adjustment speeds and reliable confidence bands that enable
me to reject flexible prices. Finally, I use the approach to carry out an empirical
specification analysis of multiple structural models. An empirical
comparison favors the sticky price explanation over the Mankiw-Reis model.

Title:  Hiding in Plain Sight – Using Signals to Detect Terrorists
Abstract:  In this paper, we study the interaction between a governmental security agency, such as the Transportation Security Agency, or the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and a terrorist organization, such as Al Qaeda. The governmental agency wants to stop the terrorists, but first must infer whether a visa applicant or an airline passenger is a terrorist or not, on the basis of some observable signal. On the other hand, the terrorist organization’s objective is to get past security to commit murder and mayhem. We derive the equilibrium strategy under these circumstances. With a signaling model we evaluate specific anti-terrorist policies such as the creation of the new Homeland Security Agency and increased airport security screening.

Title:  Expectations Anchoring in Inflation Targeting Regimes
Abstract:  Central banks adopt an inflation targeting policy with a goal to anchor inflation expectations.
We argue that the expectations anchoring test developed in the context of the Krugman (1991) exchange rate targeting
model is well-suited for inflation targeting applications. The test quantifies nonlinearity between realized and
expected inflation for very high and very low inflation levels. It does not require comparison with the control
group of non-targeting countries, avoiding critique of the benchmark approach. We test inflation targeting
in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and find weak support for expectations
anchoring.

Title:  Posted - Offer Markets In Near Continuous Time: an Experimental Investigation
Abstract:  This paper reports an experiment conducted to evaluate a ‘near continuous’ variant of the
posted-offer trading institution, where the number of periods in a market session is
increased by reducing sharply each period’s maximum length. Experimental results suggest
that although decisions in time-truncated periods are not equivalent to periods of longer
duration, extensive repetition improves considerably the drawing power of equilibrium
predictions in some challenging environments. Nevertheless, significant deviations remain
in the near continuous framework. We also observe that the extra data collected in the
near continuous framework allows new insights into price convergence and price signaling.

Title:  The smooth transition autoregressive target zone model with the Gaussian
stochastic volatility and TGARCH error terms with applications
Abstract:  This paper proposes to model the error term in smooth transition
autoregressive target zone model as Gaussian with stochastic volatility (STARTZ-SV)
or as Student-t with GARCH volatility (STARTZ-TGARCH). Using the dynamics of
Norwegian krone exchange rate index, we show that both models produce standardized
residuals that are closer to assumed distributions and do not produce a hump
in the estimated marginal distribution of exchange rate which is more consistent
with theoretical predictions. We apply developed models to test whether the
dynamics of oil price can be well approximated by the Krugman’s target zone model.
Our estimates of conditional volatility and marginal distribution reject the
target zone hypothesis.
