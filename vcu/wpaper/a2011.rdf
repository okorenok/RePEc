Title:  A Simple Approach for Organizing Behavior and Explaining Cooperation in Repeated Games
Abstract:  We introduce a novel approach for organizing behavior and explaining cooperation
in repeated games. Our approach is based on the idea that players
differ according to an inherent propensity to cooperate that systematically affects
behavior and cooperation levels. We formulate the empirical implications
of this idea and test them in the lab. Our data support our approach. Our main
conclusions are: (i) players' strategies in a repeated game can be ranked along
a single dimension, (ii) this ranking remains stable across repeated games, and
(iii) the composition of a group, in terms of its players' propensities, strongly
affects cooperation levels.

Title:  An Experimental Analysis of Contingent Capital with Market-Price Triggers
Abstract:  We report an experiment that evaluates three market-based regimes for triggering the conversion of contingent capital bonds into equity: a “fixed-trigger” regime, where a price threshold triggers mandatory conversion, a “regulator” regime, where regulators make conversion decisions based on prices and a “prediction-market” regime, where regulators also observe a market that predicts conversion. Consistent with theory, we observe inefficiencies and conversion errors in the fixed-trigger and regulator regimes. The prediction market somewhat improves the regulator’s performance, but inefficiencies and conversion errors persist. The regulator regime has conversion errors over the widest range of shocks.
