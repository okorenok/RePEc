Title:  The real effects of financial disruptions in a monetary economy
Abstract:  A large literature in macroeconomics reaches the conclusion that disruptions in financial
markets have large negative effects on output and (un)employment. Although seemingly
diverse, papers in this literature share a common characteristic: they employ frameworks
where money is not explicitly modeled. This paper argues that the omission of money
may hinder a modelâ€™s ability to evaluate the real effects of financial disruptions, since it
deprives agents of a payment instrument that they could have used to cope with the
resulting liquidity disruption. In a carefully calibrated New-Monetarist model with frictional
labor, product, and financial markets we show that output and unemployment respond
very modestly to shocks in the ability of agents to trade in the financial market. Explicitly
modeling money enables us to show that the size of the transmission mechanism between
the financial market shock and the real economy is disciplined by the inflation level.

Title:  Knowledge, Interest Rates, and Asset Price Bubbles
Abstract:  An outcome is said to be rationalizable if it is consistent with the
assumption that agents possess common knowledge of rationality. We
show that shorter investment horizons and lower interest rates produce
larger larger deviations from the unique rationalizable price path in
continuous-time asset markets. If investors possess common knowledge
of rationality, prices converge on fundamentals as quickly as possible.
Conversely, if investors possess only finite order knowledge of rational-
ity, prices exhibit bubbles and crashes that deviate from the rational-
izable price path. Shorter investment horizons and lower interest rates
are shown to amplify bubbles and crashes.

Title:  Multi-battle contests over complementary battlefields
Abstract:  This paper studies Blotto contests with divisible complementary
prizes. Each agent distributes a fixed budget over multiple battlefields.
Each battlefield has a single prize which is divided among the competi-
tors in proportion to a power function of the corresponding investment
levels. Prizes exhibit constant sub-unitary elasticity of substitution.
Such contests are shown to have pure strategy Nash equilibria under
arbitrarily sensitive battlefield success functions. In contrast, conven-
tional Blotto and Tullock contests have no pure strategy Nash equi-
libria under sufficiently sensitive battlefield success functions. These
results suggest that divisible complementary prizes can help stabilize
the distribution of resources in strategic conflicts.

Title:  Convergence Rates in Resource Allocation Games
Abstract:  If Nash equilibrium corresponds to the long run outcome of a dy-
namic process, its usefulness as a predictive tool may depend on the
rate of convergence to equilibrium. This paper experimentally tests
theoretical predictions about the rate of convergence to equilibrium
in settings where agents simultaneously allocate resources between
contests with complementary prizes. More responsive contest suc-
cess functions give agents a stronger incentive to best respond, but
learning models predict slower convergence to equilibrium under more
responsive success functions because of the incentives agents face out
of equilibrium. Consistent with learning model predictions, we observe
slower convergence under more responsive success functions, suggest-
ing that disequilibrium incentives contain useful information about the
rate of convergence to equilibrium in empirical settings.
