Title:  An Experimental Evaluation of the Over-the-Counter Search Model
Abstract:  Most financial trade occurs in decentralized over the counter (OTC) markets
which are plagued by frictions. The pioneering theoretical work of Duffie, Garleanu, and
Pedersen (2005) uses search theory to model these frictions and study price formation in
OTC asset markets. In this paper, we conduct the first experimental evaluation of the
main prediction of their model. As predicted, we find that when the asset is plentiful,
prices are lower when traders have more meeting opportunities, while when the asset
is in short supply, prices are higher when traders have more meeting opportunities. We
also find that, contrary to the theory, meetings between traders often do not result in
successful transactions and that these trade failures create additional frictions affecting
asset prices.
