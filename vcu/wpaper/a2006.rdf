Title:  Strategic Buyers, Horizontal Mergers and Synergies: An Experimental Investigation*
Abstract:  This paper reports an experiment designed to evaluate interrelationships between strategic buyers, market power and merger-induced synergies. The experiment consists of 40 posted-offer quadropolies. Treatments include the use of simulated or human buyers, seller consolidations and merger-induced fixed cost and unit cost synergies. In the simulated-buyer markets we observe behavior generally consistent with comparative static predictions: prices rise post-merger, and unit (but not fixed) cost synergies may exert some price-moderating effect. The addition of powerful buyers changes results markedly. Although prices are lower in the human buyer markets, outcomes are more variable and predicted comparative static effects are no longer observed.

Title:  International Evidence on the Efficacy of new-Keynesian Models of Inflation Persistence
Abstract:  In this paper we take an agnostic view of the Phillips curve debate, and carry out an empirical investigation of the relative
and absolute efficacy of Calvo sticky price (SP), sticky information (SI), and sticky price with indexation models (SPI), with
emphasis on their ability to mimic inflationary dynamics. In particular, we look at evidence for a group of 13 OECD countries,
and we consider three alternative measures of inflationary pressure, including the output gap, labor share, and unemployment.
We find that the Calvo SP and the SI models essentially perform no better than a strawman constant inflation model, when
used to explain inflation persistence. Indeed, virtually all inflationary dynamics end up being captured by the residuals of the
estimated versions of these models. We find that SPI model is preferable because it captures the type of strong inflationary
persistence that has in the past characterized the economies of the countries in our sample. However, two caveats to this
conclusion are that improvement in performance is driven mostly by the time series part of the model (i.e. lagged inflation)
and that the SPI model overemphasizes inflationary persistence. Thus, there appears to be room for improvement via either
modified versions of the above models, or via development of new models, that better "track" inflation persistence.

Title:  Pure Numbers Effects, Market Power, and Tacit Collusion in Posted Offer Markets
Abstract:  This paper studies the effects of seller concentration and static market 
power on tacit collusion in extensively repeated laboratory posted-offer markets. 
Contrary to the implications of some earlier research, we find that tacit collusion 
does not become pervasive with extensive repetition. In a ‘strong no power’ 
design persistently competitive outcomes are observed in markets with three or 
four sellers. Even duopolies are frequently competitive in this design. 
Unilateral market power raises prices, as predicted. However, static Nash predictions 
fail to organize outcomes across power treatments, because tacit collusion moves 
inversely with concentration. Excess capacity appears to explain observed tacit 
collusion levels.

Title:  Rebate Subsidies, Matching Subsidies and Isolation Effects
Abstract:  In a series of recent experiments (Davis, Millner and Reilly, 2005, Eckel and Grossman,
2003, 2005a-c, 2006), matching subsidies generate significantly higher charity receipts than do
theoretically equivalent rebate subsidies. This paper reports
a laboratory experiment conducted to examine whether the higher
receipts are attributable to a relative preference for matching subsidies or to
an ‘isolation effect’ (McCaffery and Baron, 2003, 2006).
Some potential policy implications of isolation effects on charitable contributions are also considered.
