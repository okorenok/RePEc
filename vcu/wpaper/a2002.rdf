Title:  Fertility and Education Premiums*
Abstract:  This paper examines households’ fertility variations in response to expected permanent shifts in
the returns to education. Wage premiums are used to measure the returns to education because their longrun
movements are driven largely by factors exogenous to the fertility process. Drawing households from
the NLS mature and younger women cohorts yields a cross-section of households (women) with time-series
variation in their childbearing years and who differ in their expectations of future wage premiums. The
results indicate that for high education parents, an increase in the expected return to college is associated
with lower fertility while an increase in the expected return to high school is associated with higher
fertility. On the other hand, low education parents tend to be unresponsive to swings in the expected
returns to either a college or high school education. These results can be consistently interpreted within a
standard quality/quantity model of endogenous fertility.
