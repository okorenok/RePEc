Title:  Raising Revenues for Charity: Auctions versus Lotteries
Abstract:  We report an experiment conducted to gain insight into factors that may affect revenues in English auctions and lotteries, two commonly used charity fund-raising formats. In particular, we examine how changes in the marginal per capita return (MPCR) from the public component of bidding, and how changes in the distribution of values affect the revenue properties of each format. Although we observe some predicted comparative static effects, the dominant result is that lottery revenues uniformly exceed English auction revenues. The similarity of lottery and English auction bids across sales formats appears to drive the excess lottery revenues.

Title:  Evidence on the Demographic Transition
Abstract:  This paper finds that fertility responds to productivity differently depending
upon the economy’s stage of development. At low levels of development, productivity
increases will increase fertility while at the more advanced stages of
development, productivity increases lower fertility. During the process there
may be important interaction effects between productivity and education demand.
Increases in secondary education demand generate fertility declines
regardless of the stage of development.
