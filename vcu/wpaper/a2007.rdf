Title:  Re-matching, Information and Sequencing Effects in Posted Offer Markets
Abstract:  This paper evaluates the effects of some standard procedural
variations on outcomes in posted offer oligopoly experiments. Variations
studied include the presence or absence of market information, the use of
re-matching or fixed seller pairs and alterations in the order of sequencing.
Experimental results indicate that such variations can have first order
effects on outcomes. For this reason, we recommend that results in oligopoly
experiments be carefully interpreted in light of the procedures selected.

Title:  Cooperation without Coordination: Signaling, Types and Tacit Collusion in Laboratory
Oligopolies
Abstract:  We study the effects of price signaling activity and underlying propensities to
cooperate on tacit collusion in posted offer markets. The primary experiment consists of an
extensively repeated baseline sequence and a 'forecast' sequence that adds to the baseline
a forecasting game that allows identification of signaling intentions. Forecast sequence
results indicate that signaling intentions considerably exceed those that are counted under a
standard signal measure based on previous period prices. Nevertheless, we find essentially no
correlation between either measure of signal volumes and collusive efficiency. A second experiment
demonstrates that underlying seller propensities to cooperate more clearly affect collusiveness.

Title:  Bayesian Methods in Nonlinear Time Series
Abstract: This paper reviews the analysis of the threshold autoregressive,
smooth threshold autoregressive, and Markov switching autoregressive models from the Bayesian perspective.
For each model we start by describing a baseline model and discussing possible extensions and applications.
Then we review the choice of prior,  inference, tests against the linear hypothesis, and conclude
with models selection. A short discussion of recent progress in incorporating regime
changes into theoretical macroeconomic models concludes our survey.
