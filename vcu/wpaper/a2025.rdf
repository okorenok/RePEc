Title:  Understanding the Educational Attainment Polygenic Index and its Interactions with SES in 
Determining Health in Young Adulthood
Abstract:  Based on the sample of The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health), we investigate the formation of health capital and the role
played by genetic endowments, parental SES, and education. To measure genetic
endowments, we take advantage of the new availability of quality polygenic indexes
(PGIs), which are weighted summaries of individual molecular genetic data. Our
main focus is on the Educational Attainment Polygenic Index (EA PGI), which is
designed to predict the highest level of education achieved in life. We find that
the EA PGI demonstrates stronger effects on health and health behaviors for subjects 
with high parental socioeconomic status (SES). These effects are only partially
explained by education as a mechanism. We provide suggestive evidence for the
mechanisms behind estimated relationships, including early health, skills, and the
parents’ and child’s own attitudes towards education, as well as outcomes related
to occupation and wealth. We also show that a strong association between education 
and health survives controlling not only for detailed traditional controls and
cognitive-noncognitive skills, but also for a large set of PGIs that proxy health, skills,
and environment, all of which are major expected confounders. This result is suggestive 
of a causal effect of education on health.
