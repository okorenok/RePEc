Title:  Advance Production, Inventories and Market Power: An Experimental Investigation
Abstract:  This paper reports an experiment conducted to assess the effects of alterations
in production conditions and product durability on market power in Bertrand-Edgeworth duopolies.
Experiment results indicate that advance production increases market power in the sense that
mean transaction prices increase relative to static Nash equilibrium predictions for a baseline market.
In a similar way, a simple inventory option reduces market power. We also find that
both advance production and inventory carryover undermine a strong tendency toward tacit
collusion observed in our baseline duopoly markets.

Title:  Impure Altruism in Dictators’ Giving
Abstract:  We design an experiment to test whether the behavior of dictators can be
rationalized by the impurely altruistic utility function. By giving the recipients an
endowment of varying levels, we create an environment that allows for observable
differences in behavior depending upon whether pure or impure altruism is the primary
motivation. We find that the behavior of 66 percent of the dictators can be rationalized by
the impurely altruistic utility function, while only 40 percent of the dictators make
choices that are consistent with the purely altruistic utility function.

Title:  Nominal Price Shocks in Monopolistically Competitive Markets: An Experimental Analysis
Abstract:  We report a market experiment that examines the capacity of price and 
information frictions to explain real responses to nominal price shocks. 
As predicted by the standard dynamic adjustment models, we find that both 
price and information frictions impede the response to a nominal shock. 
We also find, however, that the observed adjustment delays far exceed predicted levels. 
Results of a pair of subsequent treatments indicate that a combination of 
announcing the shock privately to all sellers (rather than publicly) 
and a failure of many sellers to best respond to their expectations explains the observed adjustment inertia.

Title:  Behavioral Biases, Informational Externalities, and Efficiency in Endogenous-Timing Herding Games: an Experimental Study
Abstract:  We experimentally study behavior in an endogenous-timing herding game.
We find that subjects respond to their type and to observed investment activity
in a sensible way, but there are also substantial departures from NE. Some
departures can be viewed as mere noise in decision making while other departures
represent systematic biases reflecting subjects’ failure to appreciate subtle
aspects of the game. We explore the implications of the observed departures
from NE for informational externalities and market efficiency.

Title:  An Extension of Ausubel's Auction for Heterogeneous Discrete Goods
Abstract:  Ausubel's dynamic private-values auction for heterogeneous discrete goods,
Ausubel (2006), yields an efficient equilibrium outcome
but it is designed for a limited class of environments. If bidders' values
for bundles of goods are not integers, then the auction mechanism may
not yield an efficient allocation without any information on bidders'
values. In this paper, I extend Ausubel's auction for heterogeneous
discrete goods to real-valued quasilinear utility functions. The mechanism
I propose reaches a Walrasian equilibrium price vector in finite
"steps" without any additional information on bidders' values. In the
extension of Ausubel's auction, truthful bidding constitutes an efficient equilibrium.
